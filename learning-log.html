            <h2>Getting Started with HTML & CSS</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-12-10">December 10, 2025</time>
            <p>Today I focused on the basics of HTML structure and simple CSS styling. I’m starting to understand how pages fit together and how small changes in CSS can shape the feel of a site.</p>

            <h2>Navigation States, Favicon, and Footer Enhancement</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-12-31">December 31, 2025</time>
            <p>Worked on adding several features to improve the site's polish and functionality. Added an active page indicator using aria-current="page" to show which page you're currently on. Created and implemented a favicon that now appears in browser tabs across all pages.</p>
            <p>Built an enhanced footer with navigation links, a GitHub link, and a back-to-top button. Added Open Graph meta tags so the site will display properly when shared on social media.</p>
            <p>The approach was mostly guided learning - understanding each piece before adding it. Some parts like the CSS refactoring involved more copy/paste, which is something I want to balance better. Learning to work with CSS variables, semantic HTML structure, and accessibility attributes like aria-current.</p>
            <p>Later in the session, built a project grid using CSS Grid to showcase four projects. Learned about display: grid, grid-template-columns with repeat(auto-fit, minmax()), and how to create responsive layouts that automatically adjust. Created project card components with hover effects and button styling.</p>

            <h2>Git, GitHub Pages, and Documentation Systems</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-12-31">December 31, 2025 (Evening)</time>
            <p>Major session focused on deployment and professional development practices. Learned the complete Git/GitHub CLI workflow from scratch - initializing a repository, staging changes with git add, writing meaningful commit messages, and pushing to GitHub.</p>
            <p>Deployed the site to GitHub Pages using the GitHub CLI (gh api) rather than the web interface. This taught me how to interact with GitHub's API and understand what's happening under the hood instead of just clicking buttons.</p>
            <p>Implemented a professional documentation system with four key components: DECISIONS.md (one-line decision log), ONBOARDING.md (5-minute quick start), inbox.md (low-friction capture surface), and scripts/ folder for automation. This is a "repo-first" pattern used in professional projects - keeping documentation with the code prevents it from going stale.</p>
            <p>Learned the triage workflow: capture ideas quickly in inbox.md, review weekly, then convert actionable items to GitHub Issues, move insights to DECISIONS.md, or delete what's no longer relevant. Created my first GitHub Issue via CLI using gh issue create.</p>
            <p>Also built a PowerShell script (deploy-check.ps1) that validates the site before deployment - checking for placeholder URLs and debugging console.log statements. Encountered and fixed emoji encoding issues in PowerShell.</p>
            <p>The approach was fully guided learning with step-by-step CLI commands. This hands-on method helped me understand Git concepts like staging, commits, and remote repositories. I can now maintain this site sustainably with proper version control and documentation.</p>

            <h2>Building a Responsive Hamburger Menu</h2>
            <time datetime="2026-01-03">January 3, 2026</time>
            <p>Tackled the mobile navigation issue today by implementing a hamburger menu. When I first noticed the navigation was cramped on mobile, I felt optimistic because I knew a hamburger menu would fix it—I just needed to figure out how to build one.</p>
            <p>Started by creating a GitHub issue with clear acceptance criteria, then worked through it in phases: HTML structure first, then CSS styling, then JavaScript functionality. The HTML part clicked pretty quickly when I was inputting the button structure with the three span elements for the bars. That made sense.</p>
            <p>The CSS was mostly straightforward—media queries, hiding and showing elements, transitions. I understand most of what we wrote there. The JavaScript was trickier. I vaguely understand how it works, but I think I'm still getting my head around what the variables are actually catching in context. Breaking it into small pieces helped: toggle function, close on link click, close when clicking outside, close on Escape key.</p>
            <p>The most frustrating part was when it wouldn't load properly on my phone. It worked fine in dev tools, but on my actual device it just… didn't. Turned out to be a caching issue—once I cleared the cache it loaded and worked perfectly. That felt really good. Also learned that GitHub Pages takes a few minutes to rebuild after pushing changes.</p>
            <p>Had to add the hamburger button to all six pages, then realized the footer navigation was missing two links, so I fixed that too. Followed the full workflow: implement, test, commit with clear messages, document the decision, close the issue. Also set up a Notion tracker for all my tasks with different views and priorities, which I'm really enjoying—it helps me see what to work on next.</p>
