            <h2>Starting My Personal Website</h2>            <time datetime="2025-12-15">December 15, 2025</time>            <p>Building this site has helped me understand the basics of HTML and CSS in a hands‑on way. I’m realising that learning step by step works best for me, and that small, consistent progress feels more meaningful than trying to rush ahead.</p>

            <h2>The Tension Between Speed and Understanding</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-12-31">December 31, 2025</time>
            <p>There's this pull I keep feeling — wanting to skip past the awkward, basic-looking sites and jump straight to building something that looks production-ready. But I'm starting to realize that rushing through by copy-pasting code blocks gets me features without understanding, and that's not sustainable.</p>
            <p>I'm shifting to guided learning where I'm actually typing things out and asking questions about what each piece does. It's slower, but it's the only way I'll be able to work independently and troubleshoot my own problems later. I want to be self-sufficient, not just someone who can paste together other people's code.</p>
            <p>Going through the CSS structure today didn't give me one big "aha" moment, but things are slowly starting to make more sense. I'm feeling less lost. Understanding is building gradually, and maybe that's how it's supposed to work.</p>

            <h2>Finding a Way of Learning That Actually Works</h2>
            <time datetime="2026-01-03">January 3, 2026</time>
            <p>Things feel more structured now compared to when I started. I'm building a project I actually want, in a way I'm enjoying. The guided approach—where I get a bit of direction and all the options laid out—is really helpful. I find I struggle to come up with ideas on my own, so having someone walk through the decisions and let me choose makes a big difference.</p>
            <p>I understand all the HTML we wrote today and most of the CSS. The JavaScript is still a bit fuzzy—I get the general idea, but understanding what the variables are catching in context takes more time. That's okay. It's slowly making more sense, and breaking it into small steps means I'm not just copying code I don't understand.</p>
            <p>Testing on my actual phone instead of just dev tools was eye-opening. I didn't realize how much I could actually test properly until I tried. When the menu didn't work at first, I felt frustrated—but when I cleared the cache and it loaded perfectly, that felt really good. Those little wins matter.</p>
            <p>Setting up the Notion tracker was satisfying in a different way. Seeing all my tasks organized with views and priorities makes the work feel manageable. I can see what I've done, what's next, and what I'm working toward. It's nice to have that clarity instead of just a vague list of things I should probably do someday.</p>
